# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data
In this project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The aim of this mini project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset and performed Data Exploration and Data Cleaning on that dataset.
